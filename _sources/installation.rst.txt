      conda activate orbital-radar-env

2. **Install the Package:**

   Navigate to the orbital-radar source directory and install the package using pip:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd orbital_radar-0.0.2
      python3 -m pip install .

   For development purposes, you can install the package in editable mode with
   all the development dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m pip install -e .[dev]

   For Mac users use the following line:

3. **Test the Installation:**

   To verify that Orbital Radar has been successfully installed, you can run a 
   few tests.

   - Test the package from a Python terminal:

Once you've completed the installation and verified its success, you can 
proceed to the "Getting Started" section to begin using Orbital Radar for your 
specific needs.


.. note::
    
    To make the orbital-radar-env environment available in Jupyter Lab,
    please install the ``ipykernel`` package with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda activate orbital-radar-env
        conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel
    
    Then, register the environment as a kernel with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python -m ipykernel install --user --name=orbital-radar-env
